Well, it's time to move on. This site has had its day. I am 90% done with a new version of this site, which I intend on pushing live this year. 
It was built in [Astro](https://astro.build/), which has been a ton of fun to work in.  

I need to migrate a few more content pieces over, but overall, the structure is mostly the same.  I think the design is a bit better, it's easier to read, and I'll put some more effort into posting more content there regarding work and side projects.  

I work on so many small and large things that I find out something interesting to share almost daily, so I'd like to start doing that more.

If you'd like a preview of the WIP site... [visit here](https://ccbayer-astro.vercel.app/)! Feedback is welcomed and encouraged.
