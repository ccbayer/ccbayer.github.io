## Overview

ClearChoice runs a chain of dental centers and wanted to bring the patient's treatment journey to life to allow patients to find out more about their dental procedures.  The web app integrates with their existing Salesforce data for each patient, so users can see past, future and current appointments and treatment stages.  They have the ability to message their Center and customize their profile, as well as reschedule and confirm appointments.
