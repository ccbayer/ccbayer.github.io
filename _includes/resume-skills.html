  <h3>Technical Expertise</h3>
    <strong>Data Modelling / Architecture</strong>
    <p>This skill comes into play most ofen while designing WordPress or Contentful data models, but have come into play when working on static sites as well.</p>
    <strong>Front-End Technical Architecture</strong>
    <p>This includes everything from SCSS folder structure / mixin / color systems to JS namespacing to file name and directory structures to linting rules on various platforms / frameworks.</p>
    <strong>Accessibility Testing, Auditing, Remediation</strong>
    <p>I've written very in-depth and detailed reports both pre-and post-remediation for accessibility - as well as done the work to remediate the issues.</p>
    <strong>CD / CI Pipelines</strong>
    <p>While not a dev-ops engineer, I've built pipelines - mostly for WordPress Sage 9.x based sites - in Azure Dev Ops and in CircleCI, and can direct dev ops engineers on desired outcomes based on requirements (branching / tagging strategy, etc)</p>
    <strong>Code Review</strong>
    <p>I'll catch those questionable patterns with these eagle-eyes of mine.</p>
