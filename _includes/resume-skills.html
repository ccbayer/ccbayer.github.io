<h3>Technical Expertise</h3>
<p>I've done a little bit of everything, but these are my strong suits.</p>
<strong>Data Modelling / Architecture</strong>
<p>
  This skill comes into play most ofen while designing WordPress or Contentful
  data models, but have come into play when working on static sites as well.
</p>
<strong>Front-End Technical Architecture & Builds</strong>
<p>
  This includes everything from SCSS folder structure / mixin / color systems to
  JS namespacing to file name and directory structures to linting rules on
  various platforms / frameworks. I've dealt with Gulp / Bower / Grunt /
  Webpack.
</p>
<strong>Accessibility Testing, Auditing, Remediation</strong>
<p>
  I've written very in-depth and detailed reports both pre-and post-remediation
  for accessibility - as well as done the work to remediate the issues.
</p>
<strong>CD / CI Pipelines</strong>
<p>
  While not a dev-ops engineer, I've built pipelines - mostly for WordPress Sage
  9.x based sites - in Azure Dev Ops and in CircleCI, and can direct dev ops
  engineers on desired outcomes based on requirements (branching / tagging
  strategy, etc)
</p>
<strong>Code Review</strong>
<p>I'll catch those questionable patterns with these eagle-eyes of mine.</p>
